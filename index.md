## About
Hello! I am a third-year graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln advised by [Dr. Alexandra Seceleanu](https://aseceleanu.github.io/). Broadly speaking, I am interested in homological aspects of commutative algebra.

See my cv [here](https:///bhuenemann.github.io/documents/CV.pdf).
